neurtu
======

Simple performance measurement tool

neurtu is a Python benchmarking library with a unified interface for time and memory
measurements. It aims to provide a convenient API similar to IPython's
``%timeit`` magic command, but based on delayed evaluation. Parametric benchmarks
can be used to estimate time and space complexity of algorithms, while pandas integration
allows quick analysis and visualization of the results.

*neurtu* means "to measure / evaluate" in Basque language.
